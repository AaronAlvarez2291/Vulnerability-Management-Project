# Vulnerability-Management-Project

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project was created and used to gain experience with Nessus Essentials to learn how to scan for vulnerabilities and remediate them. I will be using Nessus essentials to scan vulnerable virtual machines hosted on Oracle Virtualbox and then implementing patches to patch those vulnerable virtual machines. In this project we will be scanning our vulnerable virtual machines using both credentialed and non-credentialed scans.

<h2>Nessus & VM setup</h2>

<h2>Observation</h2>

After we configured our virtual machine and nessus essentials we first ran a uncredential scan to see what vulnerabilities we could find out about the system. As you can see from the image below we got back some vulnerabilities that our system could fi

<b>Uncredential Scan:</b>

Each tab tells us something from the host tab it shows us the severity of vulnerabilities and how much it found. from the vulnerabilities tab we can learn more about the vulnerabilities that affect this system, from the remediations tab nessus tells us how we could go about remediating these vulnerabilities, from the VPR tp threats it shows us the threats we should probably proritize and finally the history tab shows us privious scans and previous vulnerabilities we may have encountered.

<b>Credentialed Scan:</b>

As we observe both scans we can see that the credentialed scan can gives us .... compared to the Uncredentialed scan. This is because ... 

From the scan page as well we can see 5 tabs Hosts, Vulnerabilities, Remediations, VPR top threats and finally History.
