# Vulnerability-Management-Project

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project was created and used to gain experience with Nessus Essentials to learn how to scan for vulnerabilities and remediate them. I will be using Nessus essentials to scan vulnerable virtual machines hosted on Oracle Virtualbox and then implementing patches to patch those vulnerable virtual machines. In this project we will be scanning our vulnerable virtual machines using both credentialed and non-credentialed scans.

<h2>Nessus & VM setup</h2>

The first thing I am going to do is Download Nessus Essentials my Vulnerability management software. This download could take a while so while waiting for this to download we could set up our Windows 10 Virtual Machine. By following this <a href="https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/InstallNessusWindows.htm">documentation</a> you can follow along and install Nessus Essentials.

While Nessus Essentials was downloading i installed my VM using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oraclebox</a> and the windows 10 iso using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-installation-media-for-windows-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d">microsofts installation media</a>. I then configured my VM and its network adapter settings to be bridged so it can be on the same network as my native machine. By following this VM installation documentation you can follow along and install the Windows 10 VM.

I then lauched my virtual machine and checked if my virtual machine was part of my local network. 

Nessus at this point is still downloading and my Virtual Machine has successfully downloaded, so I opened up CMD to figure out the virtual machines IP address which I will need to be able to run vulnerability scans on Nessus. I named the VM Admin.

I then tried to ping the VM from my native computer to see if I can communicate with the VM. The reason I am doing this is because if I can't ping the VM then Nessus won't be able to as well and can't run its scans. As we can see the pings are timing out, meaning my native PC can't establish a connection with it at the moment.

The reason my native machine can't establish a connection is because the VM has a firewall active and it is blocking all connection attempts (which is a good thing, but not for the purposes of this project) so I have to configure the windows firewall to allow pings. By following this <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/aopy">documentation</a> i was able to configure the firewall to accept ping requests. As we can see by enabling File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In) rule in my firewall we can now see that i am allowed to ping my VM.

By the time Nessus Essentials was finished downnloading. Now the first thing i did in Nessus Essentials is create a new scan and then select basic scan.

The newly created scan then asks me to give the scan a name and select a target to scan. I configured it to scan the VM's IP address which is 192.168.100.200

This is the end of configurations for both Nessus Essentials and our virtual machine to see the results of our non-credential and credentialed scans on our VM please read the observation section.

<h2>Observation</h2>

In this  section will will discuss the scans carried out on our vulnerable VM and the results of those scans.

After I created the new scan i then launched the scan and waited for the scan to finish. We can tell when a scan is done because it will have a grey checkmark next to it.

After it was finished i clicked on the scan and found that there was 49 results, 43 of which are info and 6 medium. Info vulnerabilities tell us ... and medium severity vulnerabilities tell us ...

Since we did not provide credentials .. this scan we performed is classified as a non-credential scan.

I am now going to run a credentialed scan. Before we can do this we much first configure the VM to allow for this type of scan. Before i configure my VM i must first give my vulnerability scanner the credentials to get into the Windows 10 system.

What is a credential and non-credential scan?

<b>Uncredential Scan:</b>

<img src="">

Each tab tells us something from the host tab it shows us the severity of vulnerabilities and how much it found. from the vulnerabilities tab we can learn more about the vulnerabilities that affect this system, from the remediations tab nessus tells us how we could go about remediating these vulnerabilities, from the VPR tp threats it shows us the threats we should probably proritize and finally the history tab shows us privious scans and previous vulnerabilities we may have encountered.

<b>Credentialed Scan:</b>

As we observe both scans we can see that the credentialed scan can gives us .... compared to the Uncredentialed scan. This is because ... 

From the scan page as well we can see 5 tabs Hosts, Vulnerabilities, Remediations, VPR top threats and finally History.
