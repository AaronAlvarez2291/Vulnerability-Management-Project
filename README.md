# Vulnerability-Management-Project

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project was created and used to gain experience with Nessus Essentials to learn how to scan for vulnerabilities and remediate them. I will be using Nessus essentials to scan vulnerable virtual machines hosted on Oracle Virtualbox and then implementing patches to patch those vulnerable virtual machines. In this project we will be scanning our vulnerable virtual machines using both credentialed and non-credentialed scans.

<h2>Nessus & VM setup</h2>

The first thing I am going to do is Download Nessus Essentials my Vulnerability management software. This download could take a while so while waiting for this to download we could set up our Windows 10 Virtual Machine. By following this <a href="https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/InstallNessusWindows.htm">documentation</a> you can follow along and install Nessus Essentials.

While Nessus Essentials was downloading i installed my VM using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oraclebox</a> and the windows 10 iso using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-installation-media-for-windows-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d">microsofts installation media</a>. I then configured my VM and its network adapter settings to be bridged so it can be on the same network as my native machine. By following this VM installation documentation you can follow along and install the Windows 10 VM.

I then lauched my virtual machine and checked if my virtual machine was part of my local network. 

Nessus at this point is still downloading and my Virtual Machine has successfully downloaded, so I opened up CMD to figure out the virtual machines IP address which I will need to be able to run vulnerability scans on Nessus. I named the VM Admin.

I then tried to ping the VM from my native computer to see if I can communicate with the VM. The reason I am doing this is because if I can't ping the VM then Nessus won't be able to as well and can't run its scans. As we can see the pings are timing out, meaning my native PC can't establish a connection with it at the moment.

The reason my native machine can't establish a connection is because the VM has a firewall active and it is blocking all connection attempts (which is a good thing, but not for the purposes of this project) so I have to configure the windows firewall to allow pings. By following this <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/aopy">documentation</a> i was able to configure the firewall to accept ping requests. As we can see by enabling File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In) rule in my firewall we can now see that i am allowed to ping my VM.

By the time Nessus Essentials was finished downnloading. Now the first thing i did in Nessus Essentials is create a new scan and then select basic scan.

The newly created scan then asks me to give the scan a name and select a target to scan. I configured it to scan the VM's IP address which is 192.168.100.200

This is the end of configurations for both Nessus Essentials and our virtual machine to see the results of our non-credential and credentialed scans on our VM please read the observation section.

<h2>Observation</h2>

In this  section will will discuss the scans carried out on our vulnerable VM and the results of those scans.

After I created the new scan i then launched the scan and waited for the scan to finish. We can tell when a scan is done because it will have a grey checkmark next to it.

<img src""> scan running
<img src""> scan complete

After it was finished i clicked on the scan and found that there was 49 results, 43 of which are info and 6 medium. Info vulnerabilities tell us ... and medium severity vulnerabilities tell us ... We could also see 5 tabs when we click on the host we scanned. We can see host, vilnerabilities, Remediations, VPR top threats and finally History. The host tab shows us the host which has been scanned and info about what type of vulnerabilities have been found, the vulnerabilities tab shows us all he vulnerablities found and gives us a description of the vulnerability, the remediation tab tells us ways we can use to remediate these vulnerabilities, the VPR top threats tells us which vulnerabilities are dangerous and give us an idea of what we sgould prioritize and the history tabs shows us a history of all the scans done and their results

Since we did not provide credentials .. this scan we performed is classified as a non-credential scan.

I am now going to run a credentialed scan. Before we can do this we much first configure the VM to allow for this type of scan. Before i configure my VM i must first give my vulnerability scanner the credentials to get into the Windows 10 system.

Now its time for me to configure the VM to allow for a credentialed scan. So the first thing i did was i went into services and enabled remote registry. This will allow Nessus to coonect to the VM's registry and properly scan for vulnerabilities such as insecure connections or deprecated cipher suites. I am following this step from Nessus and what they recommended to do to run a credentialed scan.

User Controls BOii

Finally i opened the registry and added a key that is suppose to allow Nessus to connect in by further disabling user account controls. The key is a Dword key and we named the key LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy and changed the value to 1. This key is to be created in

When this is done i restarted the machine so the change i made in the registry could take effect. After this is done i returned to Nessus and ran my credentialed scan.

"> Credential Scan Running

From the results we can see that the credentialed scan has given us a lot more vulnerabilities than the first one. This is because it is able to scan deeper into the VM due to having credentials. The top picture is the new credentialed scan and the bottom picture is from the first non-credentialed scan.

What is a credential and non-credential scan?

From the results in the observation section the reason they are so diffrernt and why credentialed scan is better is because ...
